            <h2>X-wing</h2>
            <p>
            First Appearance: A New Hope
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since the starship battles in <b>A New Hope</b> were modeled after real-world dogfights, X-wings fit 
            the role of the quick, darting fighter planes that fought in them. Their maneuverability and the 
            split wings that match the X in their name make them one of the coolest starship designs in 
            <b>Star Wars</b>, utilized by the heroes of both the Original Trilogy and  Poe <b><u><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens/">The Force Awakens</a></u></b>.
            Dameron’s black-and-orange T-70 is the evolution of the classic T-65, with the same sharp 
            ferocity. The X-wing is the ship of heroes, and it looks the part.

            <h2>TIE Fighter</h2>
            <p>
            First Appearance: A New Hope 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Few can forget the cry of a TIE fighter, as it zooms over their heads or right at them at dangerous speeds. 
            Although it is absolutely the Empire’s most expendable starship, it is also its most iconic.
             The original TIE fighters from A New Hope were white in color, while the ones in <b>Empire</b> and <b>Jedi</b> were a bit grayer,
              with blue-ish hues. The signature shriek of the fighter was created by combining an elephant’s scream with the sound of a car driving on a wet road.

            <h2>Hoth</h2>
            <p>
            First Appearance: A New Hope
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Don’t panic—we didn’t forget the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy! I’d say this is the most iconic starship 
            in all of <b>Star Wars</b>. At the center of the entire Original Trilogy (and it makes a look-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo in the Prequels, 
            too!), the Falcon rightfully became one of the standout icons of the Sequel Trilogy, too.
